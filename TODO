TO DO LIST

1. Cheat Cooldown.
2. Whispering, appearing and summoning of players with spaced names. -- According to Alt, spaced names will ultimately fail. Random example: .pl Ulfric Stormcloak    will do .pl Ulfric because trinity separates spaces as separate arguments.
3. GUID of gobjects showing when you select them.
4. Allowing voters and moderators to set their own levels to 81 and 82.  --Mods can already set their own levels. We can set our level up to 85 max. Voters cannot.  -Morpheus
5. .gayporn -- Self explanatory.
